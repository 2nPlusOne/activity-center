    "description": "If virtual, first decide an order for participants to go in. The first person says a word, and the next person says the first three words that pop into their head when hearing the word. The next person says three words based on the last word of the previous participant, and so on until everyone has gone. You can then compare the first and last words for fun! For example, if the first person says 'dog', the next person could say 'cat, feline, pet'. The next person could say 'dog, bark, loud', and so on. If in a two-person group, you can take turns saying words and responding to each other's words."

    "description": "Pictionary is a classic icebreaker that can be played in many formats! If on Zoom, you can simply use the whiteboard feature. The game is commonly played by having one person pick a random word and draw it for the group to see. The other participants then try to guess what the word is. The first person to guess gets a point. There are many online variations of the game, but two popular options are gartic.io and drawasaurus.org. Skribbl.io is another choice, but the ads can be distracting. Google quickdraw is a fun option as well (an AI guesses your drawing), though it is not multiplayer."
